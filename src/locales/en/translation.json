It's like a personal map that shows us our unique characteristics and how we can live more aligned with our true nature.\n\nThe Centers in Human Design are similar to chakras and represent different aspects of human experience. They can be defined (colored) or undefined (white). Within Human Design, the centers represent different areas of energy and influence various facets of our life and personality."
